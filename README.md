# SlipperyNotes

Project made with the main idea to create a sticky notes web app, with technologies that I do not know (to learn more technologies).


# Tech Stack

 - DATABASE: PostgreSQL
 - BACK-END: [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
 - FRONT-END: [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) / [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) / [Symfony UX](https://ux.symfony.com/)
 - CSS FRAMEWORK: [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.
